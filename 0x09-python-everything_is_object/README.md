# Background Context
Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, let’s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

BTW, have you ever modified a variable without knowing it or wanting to? I mean:
```
>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
>>> a = 2
>>> b
1
>>>
```
OK. But what about this?
```
>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> m = l
>>> l[0] = 'x'
>>> m
['x', 2, 3]
>>> 
```



This project is a little bit different than the usual projects. The first part is only questions about Python’s specificity like “What would be the result of…”. You should read all documentation first (as usual :)), then take the time to think and brainstorm with your peers about what you think and why. Try to do this without coding anything for a few hours.

Trying examples in the Python interpreter will give you most of the answers without having to think about it. Don’t go this route. First read, then think, then brainstorm together. Only then you can test in the interpreter.

It’s important that you truly understand the reasons behind the answers of all those tasks so that you can apply the same logic to other variables and other variable types. The biggest mandatory task is the blog post and it will count for 50% of the total score of the project.

Note that during interviews for Python positions, you will most likely have to answer to these type of questions.

All your answers should be only one line in a file. No space before or after the answer.
